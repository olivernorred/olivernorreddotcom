# Rhoticity in live versions of Dancing Queen through the years
## Oliver Norred, 26 January 2025

Anni-Frid Lyngstad and Agnetha Fältskog recorded vocals for the studio version of [Dancing Queen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dancing_Queen) in 1975.

I was listening to that recording a few weeks ago, and I noticed that in the first chorus, when Lyngstad and Fältskog sing “you are the dancing queen,” the word “are” is pronounced in the non-rhotic, British Received Pronunciation way (“ah”), whereas in the second chorus it’s pronounced the rhotic, American way (“arr”). I dug a rabbit hole to see if I could find a trend.



[Studio recording / music video (1974)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFrGuyw1V8s&ab_channel=AbbaVEVO).\
First chorus NON-RHOTIC, second chorus RHOTIC.

[1977 in Australia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcGAA60ZWdQ&ab_channel=BobKing).\
RHOTIC first chorus NON-RHOTIC second chorus.

[1979 in London](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dEH9Ib3JZk&ab_channel=GigJunction).\
NON-RHOTIC both choruses.

[1979-80 tour of Europe and North America.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2bBTWvmN-8
&ab_channel=AbbaVEVO).\
Both choruses are NON-RHOTIC.

Definitely a limited dataset here but it seems like the later shows skew toward non-rhoticity (“British” pronunciation).
